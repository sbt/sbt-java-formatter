### Releasing

See the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) if this is your first release.

## Step 0: Create a new release tracking

1. Click ["new issue"][issues/new];
2. Opening the raw [RELEASING.md][] content; and
3. Copying the following release checklist, up to "You are done!", into the new issue and create it.

## Release checklist

* [ ] Check [closed issues without a milestone][issues/orphan] and either assign them the upcoming release milestone or 'invalid'
* [ ] Create a [new release][releases/new] with:
  * [ ] the next tag version (e.g. `v0.4.0`)
  * [ ] title and release description including notable changes
  * [ ] link to the [milestone][milestones/list] showing an overview of closed issues for this release
  * [ ] overview of contributors generated by [`sbt-authors`](https://github.com/2m/authors)
* [ ] Pull the tag, check `show version` then run `clean; publishSigned`.  You should start seeing "published sbt-java-formatter to https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/..".
* [ ] [Find, close and release][sonatype/staging-repos] your staging repository.  (See Sonatype's [Releasing the Deployment][sonatype/guide] guide.)
* [ ] [Close][milestones/list] the milestone for this release and create a new one.
